Wells and Benjamin Weinstock\nFormat:Print \n| Language:English \n| Pages:21 \nEmail\nPrint\nAbstract\nIn early 2017, Judith Judson (Harvard Business School MBA, 2000), Commissioner of the Massachusetts Department of Energy Resources (DOER), was reflecting on the results of the initiative she had led to identify the contribution advanced electricity storage could make to electricity generation and distribution in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. The study was the first major output from the $10 million Energy Storage Initiative (ESI) launched by Massachusetts Governor Charlie Baker\u2019s administration in May 2015. The advanced simulation techniques employed in the study indicated that over a ten-year period, the optimal deployment of storage capacity would cut the cost of electricity for consumers in the Commonwealth by $230 million per year, deliver $110 million in annual revenues for storage providers, and reduce CO2 emissions by 100,000 tons a year, the equivalent of taking 22,000 cars off the road. Moreover, neighboring states would benefit from $250 million in lowered wholesale prices. To deliver these benefits, 1.77 GWh of advanced storage would be required across the grid, costing between $970 million and $1.35 billion. Incorporating the perspectives of a wide body of stakeholders (from utilities to municipalities to generators), the study wound up recommending a suite of policies that would facilitate the installation of 600 MWh of storage capacity by 2025, representing about six minutes of the state\u2019s daily electricity consumption and delivering $800 million in benefits to ratepayers. It would also make the Commonwealth a leader in advanced storage technology and deliver substantial greenhouse gas reductions. At the end of 2015, according to figures from the Department of Energy, Massachusetts ranked 23rd in the United States in energy storage deployment, well behind the leader, Arizona, with nearly 300 MWh, and Texas, with over 150 MWh. However, with advances in storage technology, California promised to become the leader and had plans for nearly 1 GWh of storage capacity over the next five years. The ESI was seeking input on how to spend the balance of its $10 million budget and whether to authorize an additional $10 million on proof-of-concept deployments of the technology. Commissioner Judson pondered. Was this aggressive enough? And where did advanced storage stand in the priorities for the energy future of the Commonwealth?\nKeywords\nCitation\nEducators\nPurchase\nRelated Work\nAcelerex engaged to prepare valuation and reliability of energy storage portfolio for the New York State Energy Storage Roadmap.\nDownload the report now\n\u201cThe 2,800 MW to 3,600 MW number laid out in the roadmap was the result of analysis by consulting firm Acelerex that examined system needs that can be met by energy storage in a least\u2010cost combination of resources as New York approaches its 50% by 2030 renewable portfolio standard target.\u201d \u2013 Utility Dive\nContributing Author to IRENA Electricity Storage Valuation Framework.

Acelerex is at the heart of these two megatrends transforming the world\u2019s power grids.\u201d\n\u2014 Terry Boston, former CEO of PJM Interconnection\nCAMBRIDGE, MA, UNITED STATES, July 5, 2023/EINPresswire.com/ \u2014 Acelerex, a global pioneer in the seamless integration of best-in-class grid analytics and grid controls, announced today that it has completed an investment from a consortium of investors.\nThe investment was oversubscribed \u2013 raising 20% more than its initial target \u2013 as investors sought to benefit from Acelerex\u2019s position at the intersection of the Clean Energy Transition and technological advances in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML). The lead investor was Terry Boston, one of the world\u2019s foremost experts in managing power grid operations. Boston is the former CEO of PJM Interconnection, North America\u2019s largest power grid and the largest electricity market in the world.\n\u201cI am delighted to partner with such a distinguished group of investors, including two well-recognized power industry leaders, in scaling Acelerex. I am especially pleased that Terry Boston continues to deepen his involvement with the Company and personally led this investment. Acelerex continues to strengthen its position in clean energy and storage advisory, EMS / SCADA and data services,\u201d said Dr. Randell Johnson, Acelerex\u2019s Founder and Chief Executive Officer.\nTerry Boston commented, \u201cThe global power sector is in the early innings of both a Clean Energy Transition and a digital transformation that are reshaping the industry. Acelerex is at the heart of these two megatrends transforming the world\u2019s power grids. Acelerex\u2019s nodal analytics capabilities are essential to ensuring that renewable generation and battery storage are optimally sited. Once installed, Acelerex\u2019s grid-scale EMS and SCADA automation capabilities ensure optimal operations of these assets in real-time.\u201d\n\u201cThe Inflation Reduction Act represented an inflection point for the Clean Energy Transition in the world\u2019s largest energy market, the United States. The velocity of new power projects \u2013 both at the planning as well as operational stages \u2013 is set to markedly accelerate over the next two years. This has catalyzed demand for innovative software solutions such as Acelerex\u2019s REX\u2122 platform. Acelerex has already attracted interest from major customers and partners, with energy storage orders for its grid controls software increasing by a factor of 10x (MW basis) over the last two quarters,\u201d added Steve Bolze, who was formerly President and CEO of GE Power & Water, where he led GE\u2019s power generation and renewables businesses.\nBoston is President and CEO of Terry Boston, LLC, and a 2017 U.S. Presidential Appointee to the National Infrastructure Advisory Council (NIAC/DHS). He was previously CEO of PJM Interconnection; President of the Association of Edison Illuminating Companies; President of GO 15, the association of the world\u2019s largest power grid operators; a U.S. Vice President of the International Council of Large Electric Systems; and Chair of the North American Transmission Forum. Boston also served as Executive Vice President of Power System Operations for the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA), one of the nation\u2019s largest transmission and power supply networks.\nBolze is Founder and CEO of Massachusetts-based Standish Spring Investments. He is also an Executive Advisor at Blackstone, where he was previously Senior Managing Director and Global Head of Infrastructure Portfolio Operations. Bolze was previously President and CEO of GE Power and Water, a $28 billion unit containing GE\u2019s power generation and renewables business whose technology helped provide over 25% of the world\u2019s electricity. Bolze also served as the Co-Chair of the Electricity Technology Community for the World Economic Forum.\nAbout Acelerex\nAcelerex has developed a single Digital Grid software platform, REX\u2122, which seamlessly integrates best-in-class grid analytics and grid controls.
