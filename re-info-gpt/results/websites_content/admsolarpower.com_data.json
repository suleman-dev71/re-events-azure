During a discharge cycle, lithium atoms in the anode are ionized and separated from their electrons. The lithium ions move from the anode and pass through the electrolyte until they reach the cathode, where they recombine with their electrons and electrically neutralize. \nLithium Ion batteries have a number of advantages to traditional batteries. lithium ion batteries have one of the highest energy densities of any battery technology today. This means that they can deliver large amounts of current for high-power applications. Li-ion batteries also have low self-discharge rate of around 1.5-2% per month. Li-ion batteries charge almost 4 times faster than their alternatives. Crucially Li-ion batteries are much easier to dispose of and so are better for the environment as compared to their competitors. \nThe future is now\u2026join it with ADM Orient\nADM Orient tubular batteries : Artemis series \nADM Orient Tubular Batteries are manufactured with Heat Sealed Polypropylene Co-Polymer Monobloc casing material.

One of them is the solar-powered water pump, which helps in irrigation even in times of drought, which could compromise the food supply. They run on solar energy, being more economical, durable, and discreet than conventional pumps. This solar pump can be used in fountains, swimming pool pumps, mono-block home pumps, etc. \nThis is how a sustainable solar water pump functions\nThe solar panel receives energy from the sun in photovoltaic cells and transforms solar radiation directly into electrical energy by the \"photovoltaic effect.\" \nAfter converting the solar energy to electrical energy, the panel supplies the water pump with electrical energy directly.\nThe pump in operation can carry out the work of capturing water from the well, reservoir, and even aquifers and pumping it to the desired location.This type of system is widely used in difficult-to-access or remote places, where electricity is not conventional.
