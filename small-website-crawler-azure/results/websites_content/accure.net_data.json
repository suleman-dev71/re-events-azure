And it\u2019s determined to make the operation and charging of its electric buses safer and more reliable. With this in mind, it\u2019s announced it will be using ACCURE Battery Intelligence during a one-year trial \u2013 and thus playing a pioneering role in the field of safety. \nEach battery system continuously generates operating data and transmits it to the cloud. It\u2019s then evaluated by ACCURE\u2019s solution using artificial intelligence so that any risks can be anticipated. This allows BVG\u2019s battery department to be kept abreast of the condition of its high-voltage batteries. This in turn prevents breakdowns and improves the reliability of its bus service for passengers.\nEvery weekday, BVG\u2019s some 1,500 buses transport about a million people across Berlin. Consequently, as well as being important for public transport, these buses are a vital part of Berlin\u2019s mobility transition. In the years to come, more and more buses powered by green electricity will be employed \u2013 and their lower starting noise makes them significantly quieter than their predecessors. Accure's Battery Safety analysis software will now be used on 15 buses in BVG\u2019s electric fleet. This will enable the battery department to monitor the condition of vehicle batteries at any time by simply looking at the ACCURE dashboard and having any necessary maintenance carried out.\n\"The reliability and safety of electric buses are key to their acceptance by the public. Our analytics software can prevent bus breakdowns while improving safety,\" said Dr. Kai Philipp Kairies, CEO of ACCURE.\nTo do so, the software evaluates the data obtained from batteries several times a day. A traffic light system provides a quick and easy overview of all connected buses. As long as all the traffic lights are green, BVG\u2019s buses can continue to be used without hesitation. But if this isn\u2019t the case, the information is analyzed in more detail, and the findings are taken into consideration during maintenance. \nThanks to precise battery analysis based on operating data together with continuous safety monitoring, traditional fire safety is now supplemented by preventive precautions. As a result, ACCURE\u2019s software automatically warns of hazardous battery performance before it becomes critical. The software can easily be integrated into any application since no additional hardware or laboratory testing is required.\n\u200d\nAbout BVG\nBerliner Verkehrsbetriebe (BVG), Germany\u2019s biggest public transport company, is responding to the great ecological and social challenges of future urban travel with innovative strategies and cutting-edge technology. Every year, BVG gets over a billion passengers to their destinations on time, ecologically, and affordably with its underground, tram, bus, and ferry services."}, {"url": "https://www.accure.net/battery-knowledge/accure-battery-intelligence-partners-with-repsol-to-optimize-performance-at-energy-storage-project-in-new-mexico", "content": "News \u2013 ACCURE Battery Intelligence Partners with Repsol to optimize Performance at Energy Storage Project in New Mexico\nRIO ARRIBA, N.M., and AACHEN, Germany (September 25, 2024) \u2014 ACCURE Battery Intelligence, a leading provider of AI-based battery safety and performance technology, announced today an agreement to optimize performance and reliability of Repsol's 20 MW/80 MWh Jicarilla battery energy storage system located near the 62.5 MW Jicarilla I Solar power plant in the Jicarilla Apache Nation in northern New Mexico.\nUnder the agreement, ACCURE will use its predictive battery analytics platform to continuously monitor the battery energy storage system (BESS) and help resolve any issues found by recommending corrective actions and tracking system performance after maintenance is completed.

Analogously, battery aging can be divided into calendar and cycle aging. Let's go step by step and apply two simple rules of thumb:\nEverything that is \u201chigh\u201d harms the battery.\nThe dependencies are non-linear, with high values being much worse than low values.\nHow to Optimize Battery Lifetime During Calendar Aging\nCalendar aging occurs over time even when the battery is not in operation. It\u2019s like how we age while we sleep. The two important factors to consider are the state of charge (SOC) of the battery and the temperature of the battery while at rest.\nAccounting for State of Charge (SOC)\nHigh states of charge (SOCs) will reduce lithium-ion battery life, and small increases in SOC can significantly speed up capacity loss, especially in the upper range of the SOC. This is primarily due to the formation of certain passivation layers on the anode. \nFigure 1 depicts the relationship between high SOC and battery aging. In this experiment, several battery cells of the same type were stored at different SOCs and an elevated temperature of X \u00b0C. The values above 80% SOC show significantly greater reductions in capacity, while long lifetimes are achieved at the lower and medium states of charge. Although the quantitative correlation depends on the cell chemistry and the specific cell, this tendency applies to lithium-ion technologies in general.\nFigure 1: Calendar aging of lithium-ion batteries.\nLower Temperatures Are Ideal for Battery Lifetime\nHigh temperatures speed up chemical degradation within battery cells, leading to faster capacity loss. Like high SOCs, the interconnection between temperature and aging is non-linear with small increases leading to significant reductions in lifetime. As a rule of thumb, one can say that an increase in temperature by 10 Kelvin can halve a battery\u2019s lifetime. Conversely, lower temperatures slow down the aging processes. \nImproving Battery Life Through Optimal Cycle Aging\nCyclical aging is wear and tear that results from active battery use, much like how we age faster when we are under stress working long hours. \nLimit Depth of Discharge (DOD) by Charging Frequently\nThe depth of discharge is a percentage of that battery\u2019s total capacity that is used for a specific operation cycle. While full charges and discharges would correspond to a DOD of 100%, charging a battery from 50% to 70% and discharging it back to 50% would correspond to a cycle DOD of 20%, exactly as going from 50% to 30% and back to 50%. High DODs, for example, cause higher mechanical stress when lithium ions intercalate in electrodes and electrochemical reactions, accelerating aging.\nLike SOC and temperature, the impact of DOD on battery lifetimes is not linear, as shown in Figure 2. This experiment shows battery cells of the same type that were continuously charged and discharged under the same environmental conditions. The average state of charge was kept identical to ensure similar calendar aging. So-called equivalent full cycles are shown on the X-axis. These are calculated from partial cycles and can be seen as capacity throughput to bring results to the same scale. For example, two partial cycles of 50% correspond to one EFC. Analogously, five 20% cycles or ten partial cycles of 10% would be depicted as one EFC. While the smaller DODs achieve long lifetimes, the higher DODs lead to high-capacity losses.\nFigure 2: Cycle aging of lithium-ion batteries. The equivalent full cycles correspond to the capacity throughput. So, one 100% cycle, two 50% cycles, and ten 10% cycles would correspond to one EFC each.\nSlow Down Current Rate (C-rate)\nThe current rate is a measure of how quickly the battery charges or discharges. It is calculated by dividing the current by the nominal battery capacity. Let\u2019s do some examples: \nIf a 300 Ah cell is discharged with 300 A, the C-rate is 1 C ( = 300 A / 300 Ah), if the discharge current is only 150 A, the C-rate is 0.5 C (= 150 A / 300 Ah) in turn. \nFirst, the C-rate capability is highly dependent on the specific cell. Second, the C-rates that occur depend on the system design. For stationary large-scale storage, typical C-rates are below 1 C, as most of the systems are designed as one\u2014to four-hour systems, meaning the duration in which they can be charged or discharged at full power. \nHigh C-rates accelerate battery aging, again in a non-linear relationship. This is one area where we will break our rule that \u201ceverything that is high harms the battery, because it is especially low temperatures in combination with high charging currents that accelerate aging in the form of lithium-ion plating. This is a reason for capacity loss and possibly unsafe operational states.\nTo simplify what we\u2019ve covered above: Batteries age like rubber bands. Keeping a rubber band stretched at maximum (high SOC) for a long time (calendar aging) will make it brittle and prone to tearing. Likewise, repeatedly (cycle aging) stretching it too quickly and widely (high DOD and C-rate) will also cause it to tear much sooner than if it is only stretched gently. \nNow, let's explore how different use cases affect both calendar and cycle aging in grid-connected large-scale storage systems."}, {"url": "https://www.accure.net/battery-knowledge/ebook-bess-commissioning", "content": "eBooks \u2013 Four Ways to Accelerate BESS Commissioning\nThe faster you get your battery energy storage system (BESS) up and running, the faster you profit from the electricity you sell.

That is 66% without any mechanical impact! In the first quarter of 2022, about 86 cases were disclosed to the media, of which 27.5% caught fire while charging and 38.5% while parked.1\nScary, but not surprising! Why? \nLet me explain.\nWhen a vehicle is charged, the battery should be safeguarded by the battery management system. But still, sometimes fires happen. How can that be? \nTo understand the role of battery management systems in battery safety, we need to understand what a BMS is. The battery management system is an integral part of all high-voltage battery systems. Think of it as the brain of any battery storage unit. It measures, monitors, controls, communicates and, most importantly, is responsible for safety through decision-making. The quality of these decisions has a direct impact on system safety. \nSo, the battery management system makes critical decisions to ensure system safety and deals with lots of data to do its job. Surely, that means the more data, the merrier, right? Not really. Throwing in additional sensors, additional algorithms, and complex systems logic might sound logical to make better decisions, but these can sometimes be counterproductive.\nLots of data does not equal better decisions\nDecision-making should be a meticulous process of data handling and analyzing. Data needs to be acquired, stored, processed, sorted, and finally used as the base for decisions. To understand this, let us look at the following challenges: \nAnalyzing data is a processor-intensive task. The more data you process, the longer it takes to find the decision-critical data and for the decision to happen. This leads to delayed and poor decisions. \nData traffic and bandwidth in BMS channels are a real problem! Just like your PC might sometimes feel bottlenecked with your inputs and freezes to sort out the data, BMSs also encounter such freeze situations, leading to delayed and error-prone decision-making. \nHigh-volume data does not always translate to a better decision. Often, the design choice is to pack more sensors to get more data points, not considering qualitative factors. The design language should focus on a qualitative, rather than quantitative approach to acquire data. \nThe BMS hardware design should be cohesive with the data environment. This defines how a good BMS design enables better decision-making overall. \nIf I were to choose, I would choose less but more strategically clever data. How much is too much is subjective to individual design, so there is no one-solution-fits-all. But, in simple words: too much data is sometimes worse than poor data! \nAre all battery fires due to BMS mishaps?\nCertainly not. It is fair to point out cell quality or go a step further and point out the chemistry or type of cell. But if the fire starts spontaneously while charging, it is usually the battery management system that needs to be addressed. Because regardless of the cell type (cylindrical, prismatic, pouch), if you keep pumping in current beyond a certain limit, you will hurt the cells. So, what is supposed to prevent this from happening? Usually, the BMS \u2013 in some cars, the Vehicle Control Unit (VCU) also has a part to play. \nIt is easier (mostly fair, too) to blame the cell. But the cell is just an \u201cenergy storage unit.\u201d Think of it as a water tank and your current as water. If you keep filling the tank beyond the point of capacity, it is going to overflow. It is the job of the control unit\u2014the brain\u2014to monitor the water level, communicate with the water pump, and to stop pumping water into the tank if required. To do so, it must consistently and diligently measure the water level."}, {"url": "https://www.accure.net/battery-knowledge/large-battery-storage-system-cell-aging", "content": "Blog \u2013 Cell Aging Variation in Large Battery Storage Systems\nCalendar vs. Cycle Battery Aging\nLike humans, battery cells exhibit varying aging behavior and associated life expectancy. Battery aging is divided into calendar aging and cyclic aging. To maintain the human analogy, calendar aging corresponds to the constant degradation each of us experiences. Even when we sleep, we wake up a day older. Likewise, batteries age when not in operation, losing capacity and performance. The main factors influencing calendar aging are state of charge and temperature, with higher temperatures and state of charge leading to accelerated aging. The relationship is nonlinear and especially strong for high states of charge and temperatures.\nRegarding cycle aging, we can again draw parallels with ourselves. Just as stress, intense and prolonged work, and insufficient sleep contribute to faster aging in humans, similar conditions in batteries, such as charge throughput, cycle depths, and charging currents, have a negative impact. A simplified rule applies here: higher values significantly harm the battery compared to lower values.\nDifferences in Aging Across System Cells\nWhen we talk about a megawatt or gigawatt battery storage, we are not referring to a single large battery but to thousands of small battery cells, initially organized into modules, then packs, racks, and eventually entire containers. These containers are, in turn, installed together for large-scale storage projects.\nIt is almost impossible to expose each cell to the same environmental and operating conditions. This is due, on the one hand, to the system design and, on the other hand, to the operation. For instance, battery cells inside a module are exposed to higher temperatures than those at the edges, and modules at the top of a container may be subjected to warmer rising air than modules at the bottom if the air circulation is not maintained correctly or if the cooling system is not functioning perfectly.\nDuring operation, not all strands are used the same. For example, power distribution algorithms improve efficiency by using just some containers. Over time, they may exhibit different capacities and performance capabilities. \nIt is clear that even if all batteries were identical, they would age differently due to varying environmental and operational conditions. This effect is further intensified by the fact that battery cells, like humans, are not identical. Similar to genetic predispositions or circumstances that develop over the course of life, batteries also exhibit slight variations due to production and operational factors, which become more pronounced during operation.\nTo illustrate this, the study conducted by Baumh\u00f6fer et al. is beneficial. In this study, 48 batteries of the same type and delivered on the same day were aged under identical conditions in the laboratory, clearly demonstrating the mentioned effects.\nFigure 1: 48 cells of the same batch cycled under the same environmental and operational conditions. Data from Baumh\u00f6fer et al.: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpowsour.2013.08.108\nWhile the cells are initially quite close to each other, the capacity spread between the best and worst cells becomes visibly pronounced after several hundred cycles. Consequently, there can be a considerable number of cycles between reaching the typically assumed end-of-life of 80% of the initial capacity. In reality, the divergence in health conditions would have been even more significant if different temperatures, states of charge, and loads had been introduced."}, {"url": "https://www.accure.net/battery-knowledge/reducing-oem-financial-risk-by-preventing-battery-fires-in-electric-vehicles", "content": "Editorials \u2013 Reducing OEM Financial Risk by Preventing Battery Fires in Electric Vehicles\nBatteries are at the heart of our energy and mobility future. But with the ever-increasing numbers of deployed battery packs around the world, we also see more incidents of failing systems \u2013 from burning electric scooters in apartment buildings in New York City to a series of electric bus fires in Paris and London. So, what are our options to prevent critical failures and make batteries\u2014and clean energy\u2014as safe as possible? \nFaults and financials\nThe financial risks associated with faulty electric vehicle (EV) batteries can be derived from two major recalls that happened after a series of battery fires in 2020 and 2021. In both cases, batteries from LG went into thermal runaway during orafter charging:\nThe US$900 million Hyundai Kona case \n(at least 15 incidents)\nHyundai first tried to fix the battery issue with a software update for the battery management system. When an updated Kona EV caught fire in January 2021, Hyundai issued a general recall of all its 76,000 Kona electric vehicles and 6,000 IONIQ models and electric buses that use battery cells made by LG Chem. The recall ended up costing Hyundai US$900 million.\nThe US$1.9 billion Chevrolet Bolt case \n(at least 17 incidents)\nGeneral Motors (GM) tried two iterations of software updates but was unable to prevent more battery fires, among others in Virginia and Vermont, U.S. After that, GM told customers to park their EVs outside and not charge them unattended, before finally issuing a formal recall a week later. The recall became the most expensive recall ever on a per-vehicle basis and eventually led LG to compensate GM over US$1.9 billion.\nThe route to safer batteries \nSo, what are the options to make batteries safer and to reduce financial risk? Generally speaking, there are three main areas: \n1. Production quality\n2. System design\n3. Battery analytics \n1. Production quality\nTo operate safely, batteries need to be produced with the utmost care and precision, from processing active materials to manufacturing the cells to assembling the pack. Any production defect can lead to unexpected (and sometimes critical) behavior years later. \nThe only solution to control manufacturing defects is rigorous quality management from incoming goods control to end of line testing. But there are two major challenges: for one,most mid-stream companies in the EV space have neither the full information about, nor the ability to impact the quality of the cells and packs they buy. On the contrary, in today\u2019s market, the sheer ability to buy batteries from a supplier weighs heavier than any quality management (QM) certification. On top of that, even the most rigorous quality management will never catch 100% of the failures. \n2. System design\nBattery systems are equipped with several layers of protection meant to keep the battery in its intended window of operation, shield it from external harm, and minimize the impact of asingle-cell failure. \nPassive safety components: From sturdy packaging to withstand crashes to hermetic sealing against water inflow, these passive safety components are last resorts to minimize the damage from critical situations that are already happening. They generally cannot prevent safety incidents. \nBattery management system (BMS): BMSs are the brain of every Lithium-ion battery (LIB) system. They make sure a cell is not over or undercharged and they bring basic state estimation functionalities with them, including state of charge (SOC) and state of health (SOH). However, BMSs also have noticeable shortcomings: they only see the cells within the corresponding battery pack, have little to no access to historic data or data from other battery systems, and they have limited computing power. \nThe limitation of BMS safety algorithms was highly visible in the attempts of Hyundai and GM to solve their safety problems with a firmware update (in other words a BMS software update). While it\u2019s possible to locally scan the sensor data for anomalies, such as rapidly changing impedances or sudden voltage drops, as precursors for thermal events, the lack of baseline data and ongoing comparisons to similar systems strongly limits the value of such analyses. \n3. Cloud-based battery analytics\nA proven strategy to prevent critical failures and improve battery safety is the use of cloud-based analytics. By detecting critical faults at an early stage using more sophisticated and modern analytical methods than available in any battery management system, automobile manufacturers and electric car owners can act before any damage is done. Diagnostics based on existing field data streams can be applied to any LIB system without the need for any product modification."}, {"url": "https://www.accure.net/battery-knowledge/white-paper-predictive-safety-analytics", "content": "White Papers \u2013 Predictive Safety Analytics\nTo remain a key pillar of our energy and mobility world, batteries must be safe and reliable. If li-ion batteries fail to charge or operate safely, or are damaged, they pose a serious fire hazard. In the past year we have seen large scale stationary storage fires in Arizona, USA, e-bus fires in London, England, Paris, France and Stuttgart, Germany and multiple electric vehicle fires from GM, Tesla, and others."}, {"url": "https://www.accure.net/battery-knowledge/lithium-ion-battery-safety", "content": "Blog \u2013 Lithium-Ion Battery Safety: Effective Long-Term Strategies\nSo, what can lithium-ion battery manufacturers, system developers, and operators do to reduce failures and ensure safety? There are three layers necessary for maintaining a safe and reliable battery system.\nLayer 1: Production Quality Control and Aging Tests\nLayer 2: The Battery Management System\nLayer 3: Put the Cloud to Work\nThese three layers are analogous to a rally, where we need a reliable car, a driver, and a co-pilot.\nLayer 1: Production Quality Control and Aging Tests \nThe batteries can be seen as the rally car. For a rally, we need a reliable car of high quality. \nHowever, cell manufacturers cannot guarantee 100% quality of every cell. Therefore, quality tests play a crucial role in traditional methods to prevent lithium battery failures.\nEnd-of-line tests are done after production to see if a battery meets given quality standards. These tests are typically not very thorough, but they sort the obvious bad apples out of the lot. Shortly after production, analyses such as initial capacity or impedance measurements are often used to help identify faulty cells.\nCertification tests are essential for every product as they must be fulfilled from a legal perspective. In these tests, standardized tests must be conducted, and the manufacturers must prove safety-relevant behavior. \nTo get an idea of the batteries\u2019 aging behavior, both calendar and cycle tests are run over months and years in defined lab tests. However, these tests take time, are costly, only control a subset of batteries, and are not scalable for field-deployed systems. Batteries that are on our roads, in our homes, or connected to the grid experience way different environmental conditions and load profiles than can be tested in the lab. \nProduction quality tests evaluate only a specific point in time, which is why additional safety layers are needed.\n\u200d\nLayer 2: The Battery Management System\nThe battery management systems (BMSs) can be seen as the rally drivers that focus on the road and continuously keep the car safe on track. However, they need more time and resources to see the bigger picture.\nBMSs keep the batteries in their intended window of safe operation and minimize the impact of a single-cell failure on the affected pack or module. They do this by: \nMeasuring the voltage, current, and temperature of the battery\nCalculating and monitoring the state of charge (SOC)\nBalancing cells to the same voltage levels for safe operation\nIf values come close to their edge values or exceed the boundary conditions, the BMS should bring the system to a safe state by changing operation or shutting the battery system. BMSs are a reactive, but necessary safety measure. \nUnfortunately, there are shortcomings as BMSs:\nOnly see the present condition\nOnly see the cells within the corresponding battery pack\nAre limited in computing power and follow simple rules\nDue to these limitations, BMSs cannot detect safety-relevant anomalies that happen within the specified value ranges, run deep analytics to calculate the battery state more accurately, or predict long-term trends. As prior incidents have shown, BMS limitations can play a role in lithium-ion battery failures, leaving companies at risk. This also increases the complexity of assessing safety risk because the quality of the BMS needs to be considered in addition to the manufacturing quality of the cells. Sensors can fail, leading to safety-critical events. Possible improvements can be made in sensor quality and computational power, leading to higher costs. But the question remains: If the BMS watches the battery \u2013 who watches the BMS?"}]
