Seller objects to any terms introduced by Buyer and rejects them in their entirety; no terms of Buyer will be of any force or effect.\nIf Buyer is purchasing on credit, Buyer must have on file with Seller an approved Online Credit Application. For any purchase on credit, Buyer consents to Seller\u2019s Credit Agreement, the terms and conditions of which Buyer acknowledges having read and understood and are incorporated by reference herein. All accounts past due are subject to a monthly late payment charge, not to exceed the maximum allowed by applicable state and federal law. By purchasing from Seller, Buyer represents and warrants that Buyer is not a \u201cconsumer\u201d as that term is defined in any applicable state and federal consumer protection laws and Buyer agrees to indemnify and hold harmless Seller against any legal matter based on a claim or finding that Buyer is a \u201cconsumer.\u201d\nSeller\u2019s acknowledgement and acceptance of Buyer\u2019s order is expressly conditioned upon Buyer\u2019s acceptance of these terms and conditions. No terms or conditions, and no written or oral agreement that purports to vary these terms and conditions, is binding upon Seller unless set forth in writing, signed by an officer of Seller. All negotiations, proposals and representations are merged herein, and this writing constitutes the complete and exclusive statement of the terms and conditions of the Purchase Agreement between Buyer and Seller. BUYER ACKNOWLEDGES THAT BUYER IS NOT RELYING ON ANY REPRESENTATION OR PROMISE OF SELLER THAT IS NOT EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS PURCHASE AGREEMENT. In the event Buyer fails to accept this Purchase Agreement in writing, Buyer\u2019s consent to the terms and conditions herein is conclusively presumed, either from Buyer\u2019s failure to object within five calendar days in writing or from Buyer\u2019s acceptance or use of the material delivered hereunder. Unless Buyer notifies Seller in writing to the contrary prior to making a purchase, Buyer represents and warrants that any employee or agent action on Buyer\u2019s behalf is authorized by Buyer to do so and Seller may rely upon such representation.\nIn any case in which Seller makes delivery, Buyer will pay Seller\u2019s customary shipping charges. Delivery will be made at the project site or other place of delivery adjacent to the closest public right of way. Title and risk of loss passes to Buyer upon delivery of the goods. Should Buyer not be present to accept delivery, Buyer authorizes Seller to unload the goods and leave them at the delivery destination. Buyer releases Seller and will indemnify and hold harmless Seller from and against any and all claims demands, actions, causes of action, cost, expenses, and attorneys\u2019 fees arising out of or in connection with any and all injury including death, to any person or persons (whether third parties or agents, servants, or employees of Buyer), any and all damages to or loss of any property (whether belonging to Buyer or a third party), and any and all other damages recognized at law or in equity caused in whole or in part by or in any way related to the delivery of goods onto (or adjacent to) the project site by Seller, whenever such delivery is made in accordance with or pursuant to Buyer\u2019s instruction or authorization.\nBuyer has the right to inspect the goods upon arrival. Buyer\u2019s inspection rights expire three (3) days after the arrival of the goods at the delivery destination. A failure to make inspection within that time waives notice of any defect that a reasonable inspection would have revealed. A rejection of the goods by Buyer is not effective unless written notice of rejection is given to Seller within three (3) days of delivery.\nWithout prejudice to any other rights, Seller may suspend further deliveries of any goods purchased if Buyer defaults in payment of any amounts due, or whenever Seller may deem itself insecure as to Buyer\u2019s performance, until Buyer remedies such default or provides assurance that satisfies Seller in its sole discretion, of Buyer\u2019s ability to perform. Seller may cancel any order at any time prior to payment by Buyer.\nUnless otherwise provided by law, Seller may require Buyer to pay or to reimburse Seller for any tax (except income tax) which now or hereafter is imposed by any taxing authority with respect to the goods purchased or the sale, purchase, manufacture, delivery or use thereof.\nSeller reserves the right to discontinue, without liability, deliveries of any goods, the manufacture, use and/or sale of which in the opinion of Seller would infringe any patent now or hereafter issued, or other intellectual property right under which Seller is not licensed.\nWhere Buyer requires tests or inspection not regularly provided by Seller, Seller may charge Buyer for the actual cost of such test or inspections.\nBuyer\u2019s wrongful nonacceptance of goods, or cancellation or repudiation of an agreement to purchase goods or services entitles Seller to recover, in addition to any incidental damages caused by Buyer\u2019s wrongful nonacceptance, cancellation or repudiation, either (i) in the case of goods which cannot reasonably be resold by Seller to a third party, or service which have already been performed by Seller, the price of such goods or services; or (ii) in the case of goods for which other buyers exist or services not yet performed, or where an action for the price is not otherwise permitted by law, twenty percent (20%) of the contract price as liquidated damages (which constitute a reasonable estimate of Seller\u2019s loss and not a penalty). In the case of special orders, all Seller\u2019s out-of-pocket expenses, if any, incurred prior to receipt by Seller of notice of cancellation by Buyer, in connection with providing special services, developing special tooling, purchasing special supplies and the like are recoverable, in addition to the foregoing.\nSeller is not responsible for and will not liable for any damages (of any nature whatsoever) for any delay caused in whole or in part by circumstances beyond Seller\u2019s reasonable control, including but not limited to, force majeure, fires or accidents; strikes or other differences with workers; war (whether declared or undeclared), riots or embargoes; delays by carriers; delays in shipment or receipt of materials from suppliers; or any legislative, administrative or executive law, order or requisition of the federal or any state or local government or any subdivision, department, agency, officer or official thereof. In the event of any shortage of goods, Seller may allocate its available supply among Seller\u2019s customers, including Seller\u2019s branches and affiliates, in any manner Seller deems reasonable.\nBUYER ACKNOWLEDGES THAT BUYER\u2019S PURCHASE DECISION IS BASED SOLELY UPON BUYER\u2019S DUE DILIGENCE OF THE GOODS REQUIRED BY BUYER AND NOT BY REASON OF OR RELIANCE ON ANY STATEMENT MADE BY OR ON BEHALF OF SELLER AS TO THE MERCHANTABILITY, SPECIFIC ATTRIBUTES OR OTHER INFORMATION REGARDING THE GOODS. In the case of goods manufactured and sold by Seller with a separate written warranty, that warranty will apply. Otherwise, in the case of goods manufactured and sold by Seller, Seller warrants only that such goods have been manufactured in accordance with Seller\u2019s specifications and are free from defects in material and workmanship at the time of sale. For all other goods, upon request, Seller makes no warranties, but will assign or transfer to Buyer any assignable or transferable manufacturer\u2019s warranties, if any, applicable to the purchase, in lieu of all other warranties, express or implied. EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY PROVIDED HEREIN, SELLER MAKES NO WARRANTIES, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, AND SPECIFICALLY DISCLAIMS ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES INCLUDING ANY IMPLIED WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THERE IS NO WARRANTY THAT EXTENDS BEYOND THOSE GIVEN IN THIS PURCHASE AGREEMENT. Buyer acknowledges that lumber and other product dimension descriptions are made consistent with industry standards and do not necessarily represent exact or accurate dimensions. For example, lumber commonly called \u201c2\u00d74\u201d is actually 1.5 inches deep by 3.5 inches wide.\nAs a courtesy to Buyer, Seller may, upon request, provide certain services ancillary to the supply and delivery of building materials. These ancillary services may include, but are not limited to, identifying potential installers for the goods purchased from Seller, assisting in field measurements, preparing shop drawings and visiting job sites. Seller makes no warranties regarding such ancillary services; they are provided AS IS \u2013 WHERE IS and Seller disclaims all warranties with respect to the same, either express or implied. In the event Seller provides ancillary services, it is Buyer\u2019s sole responsibility to conduct its own independent diligence regarding the services including verifying field measurements, inspecting construction work and selecting installers. Seller is not liable for any actions of any installer(s) or any defect in any work, whether or not the installer is suggested by Seller.\nBuyer\u2019s Remedies/Seller\u2019s Limitation of Liability: (a) Buyer\u2019s sole and exclusive remedy and the limit of Seller\u2019s liability for goods or services proven to be other than warranted, whether based upon breach of warranty, negligence, strict liability, tort, breach of contract or any other legal theory, will be, at Seller\u2019s option, (i) replacement of the goods or services, without charge, carriage paid to Buyer\u2019s facility; or (ii) refund of the purchase price paid in respect of such goods or services, plus commercially reasonable charges in connection with the return or disposition of goods (if applicable). Seller\u2019s liability will not exceed the aggregate purchase price of the particular goods and services with respect to which losses, damages, expenses or costs are claimed. Buyer must make any claim against Seller (whether sounding in contract or tort) within 12 months of the date of shipment of the goods or performance of the services, and any such claim not made within such 12-month period is irrevocably waived.\n(b) SELLER IS NOT LIABLE FOR ANY CONSEQUENTIAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, INDIRECT, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMGES, LOSS OF ANTICIPATED PROFIT, UNABSORBED OVERHEAD, INTEREST ON CLAIMS, PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT AND ENGINEERING COSTS, FACILITIES AND EQUIPMENT REARRANGEMENT COSTS OR RENTAL, UNAMORTIZED DEPRECIATION COSTS, AND GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE BURDEN CHARGES TO ANY PERSON, WHETHER BASED UPON BREACH OF WARRANTY, NEGLIGENCE, STRICT LIABILITY, TORT, BREACH OF CONTRACT OR ANY OTHER THEORY, REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THE REPLACEMENT OR REFUND REMEDY SET FORTH ABOVE FAILS OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE OR FOR ANY OTHER REASON WHATSOEVER. Seller will not be liable for any damages attributable to product abuse, misuse, neglect or any other cause, which is not the fault of Seller.\n(c) The limitation of liability set forth in this paragraph will survive termination or cancellation of this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, Seller is not liable for any damages whatsoever whether direct or indirect resulting from any delay in delivery of the goods or failure to deliver the goods in a reasonable time \u2013 whether or not such delay or failure is caused by Seller.\nSeller has no liability to any person other than Buyer by virtue of the sale of the goods or services, or any other matters contemplated by this Agreement. There are no third-party beneficiaries to this Agreement. If Buyer is purchasing goods for re-sale, Buyer will add Seller as a party protected by Buyer\u2019s warranty and limit of liability provisions in Buyer\u2019s terms of sale.\n(a) Buyer agrees to indemnify and hold harmless Seller from and against any and all claims, demands, actions, causes of action, costs and expenses arising out of or in connection with, in whole or in part, any act(s) or omission(s), negligent or otherwise, of Buyer, or any of Buyer\u2019s agents, servants, employees, subcontractors or customers, including but not limited to: (i) claims of personal injury, including death, to any person or persons (whether third parties or agents, servants or employees of Buyer or Seller); (ii) claims of loss of any property, real or personal (whether belonging to Seller, Buyer or to a third party); and (iii) any and all other damages recognized at law or in equity under any theory whatsoever.\n(b) This indemnity includes, but is not limited to, any reasonable attorney\u2019s fees or other reasonable legal fees incurred by Seller and associated with the foregoing.\n(c) This indemnity provision is a material term to the Agreement. Buyer\u2019s duty to indemnify is a condition to the sale of any goods from Seller to Buyer. Buyer has read the indemnity provision in its entirety, understands each and every part of the provision and acknowledges that there is no ambiguity concerning Buyer\u2019s duty to indemnify.\n(d) In the event that the applicable law prohibits enforcement of this clause as written, then and only then, this clause will be modified to provide the maximum indemnification to Seller, as indemnitee, allowable under that applicable law.\nBuyer represents and warrants that it has complied and will comply with all applicable laws, rules and regulations pertaining to the export, import and movement of the goods sold hereunder. All drawbacks of duties paid on items used in the manufacture of the goods delivered hereunder will accrue to the Seller, and Buyer agrees to furnish the Seller with all documents and cooperation necessary to obtain payment of such drawbacks.\nThis Agreement will be governed by and construed according to the laws of the state where the Seller branch supplying the goods hereunder is situated. Any action brought upon, or by reason of, this Agreement will be brought, in Seller\u2019s sole discretion, either in a court with jurisdiction over the county in which the Seller branch is located, in a court with jurisdiction over the county in which the project for which the goods are to be used is located, or in a court or before an arbitration panel where an action between Seller and a third party is pending which concerns the subject matter of this Agreement. Buyer agrees that, in the event any action is brought upon, or due to, this Agreement by either Buyer or Seller, and Seller prevails, Buyer will pay Seller\u2019s reasonable attorney\u2019s fees and other costs incurred because of or in connection with such action, in the maximum amount permitted by law.\nWaiver by Seller of any terms or conditions of this contract or waiver of any breach hereof will not be construed as a waiver of any other term, condition, or breach. Determination that any provision of this Agreement is illegal or invalid will not affect the validity or enforceability of the remaining provisions of this Agreement.\nReturns must be made in accordance with Seller\u2019s return policy. A copy of this policy may be found at https://abcsupply.com/services/return-policy/ or is available upon request.\nThe purchase of goods or services will not entitle Buyer to use, or otherwise identify Buyer or its business with the name, trademark or other identity of Seller. Should Buyer violate this provision, Seller reserves all remedies provided for by law or in equity, including, without limitation, injunctive relief.\nT/D symbols printed on the front of any Seller warehouse picking/delivery ticket, invoice, or statement represents the tax and discount status of individual items. The following is a description of each symbol or combination of symbols:\n/ = Taxable regardless of the order\u2019s tax status\n\\ = Nontaxable regardless of the order\u2019s tax status\n= Non-discountable regardless of the order\u2019s terms\n/ = Taxable and non-discountable regardless of the order\u2019s tax status and terms\n\\ = Nontaxable and non-discountable regardless of the order\u2019s tax status and terms\nIf the item is taxable, and discountable based on the order\u2019s tax status and terms, no symbol will print.\nThe acceptance of this order is expressly limited to the terms herein and any additional or different terms suggested by the Seller are hereby rejected unless agreed to in writing by ABC.

In the event approval is not obtained, this order is cancelled with no liability on the part of either ABC or Seller, unless the order is placed with the understanding that the material and/or equipment is to be supplied of the type and in such a manner as to meet requirements of specifications.

This order shall be binding upon and shall benefit the parties hereto and their respective successors, assigns, heirs, administrators, executors and legal representatives, provided that nothing contained in this paragraph shall be construed so as to authorize Seller to make any assignment or transfer prohibited by paragraph 9 above.\nSeller agrees to comply with all applicable laws, ordinances, orders, regulations, and directives in any manner relating to or connected with employment (including but not limited to the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, as amended) and Seller shall require compliance therewith by all suppliers and subcontractors with whom Seller may contract for anything relating to any material and equipment furnished hereunder.\nSeller warrants that all equipment and material furnished hereunder is in full compliance with the requirements of the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970, the Construction Safety Act of 1969, any other applicable federal, state or local laws, ordinances or statutes concerning safety or product liability (including any common law duty to label or warn) and including all standards and regulations thereunder (collectively \u201cLaws\u201d), and Seller agrees to and shall indemnify, protect and hold harmless ABC from and against all claims, liability, loss, damage and expense, including ABC\u2019s attorney\u2019s fees, for any claimed violation of the Laws arising out of or resulting from the equipment or material furnished hereunder and Seller shall directly receive and be responsible for all citations, assessments, fines or penalties which may be incurred by reason of the failure of the equipment or materials furnished hereunder to comply with the Laws.\nOur Hassle-Free Return Policy\nIf you return a product to an ABC Supply location in resalable condition within 30 days of purchase with the receipt, you will receive a full refund.

CREDIT AGREEMENT\nCREDIT TERMS & CONDITIONS\nAs a condition to the election of American Builders & Contractors Supply Co., Inc., a Delaware corporation with its principal place of business at its National Support Center at One ABC Parkway, Beloit, Wisconsin (d/b/a \u201cABC Supply Co., Inc.,\u201d and \u201cBradco Supply,\u201d among others) (hereinafter, \u201cSeller\u201d) to extend credit to Buyer, Buyer has executed Seller\u2019s Credit Application and agrees to the following terms and conditions for all purchases made by Buyer from Seller or any of its subsidiaries. All purchases by Buyer from Seller are made pursuant to this Credit Agreement, the Seller Credit Application, and Seller Terms of Sale. The terms and conditions of the Seller Credit Application and the Seller\u2019s Terms of Sale (https://www.abcsupply.com/terms-of-sale) are incorporated by reference herein. Any payments made through Seller\u2019s Internet-based Invoice Gateway (more information at https://account.abcsupply.com/) are also subject to the terms and conditions of the Invoice Gateway, which Buyer hereby acknowledges and accepts. The Credit Application, Credit Agreement, the Terms of Sale and the Invoice Gateway terms and conditions (if applicable) together constitute the entire agreement between Seller and Buyer and will be collectively referred to from time to time as the Agreement. In the event of any conflict in the terms of the aforementioned, the terms of the Seller Purchase Agreement will control.\n1. Buyer will pay each invoice in full in accordance with the terms of the particular Purchase Agreement, invoice, or other shipping document, with or without Buyer\u2019s signature. In the event Buyer fails to make payment when due, Buyer will pay, in addition to the invoice amount, a monthly late payment charge of 1.5%. Seller reserves the right to change such charges from time to time in its sole discretion and without notice. All payments are due within terms. Buyer agrees that should the late payment charge be deemed by a court of competent jurisdiction to violate any law, Buyer\u2019s sole remedy against Seller for such violation will be the application of any late payment charge paid in excess of the maximum rate allowable by law toward the unpaid account balance (or a refund of such excess if no account balance remains unpaid).\n2. Buyer agrees to pay all costs of collection by Seller of any amounts due hereunder, including actual attorney\u2019s fees. Buyer further agrees that, in the event any action arising out of or related to the Agreement between Buyer and Seller, and Seller prevails, Buyer will pay Seller its actual attorney\u2019s fees and other costs incurred as a result of or in connection with such actions. To the extent state law limits the recoverability of attorney\u2019s fees, Seller will be entitled to recover its fees up to the maximum allowed by state law.\n3. Buyer grants Seller authorization to perform a credit check and obtain a credit report for Buyer on an annual basis, or more frequently as Seller may deem necessary.\n4. Seller will have the sole discretion and complete right to apply any payment received from Buyer hereunder in a manner that Seller deems proper.

Rebate Recipient further confirms Rebate Recipient\u2019s consent to ABC\u2019s Credit Application and Agreement, the terms and conditions of which have been read by Rebate Recipient and are incorporated by reference herein. Rebate Recipient must remain current at all times on Rebate Recipient\u2019s credit account and must not be in breach of the Credit Application and Agreement to maintain eligibility for rebates. Any breach or default under the Credit Application and Agreement relieves ABC from any obligation to pay any rebates under any Rebate Program, whether or not such rebates have accrued.\nParticipation in any Rebate Program is expressly conditioned upon Rebate Recipient\u2019s acceptance of the terms and conditions herein. No terms or conditions other than those stated herein, whether contained in Rebate Recipient\u2019s purchase order, shipping release, or elsewhere, and no written or oral agreement that purports to vary these terms and conditions shall be binding upon ABC unless hereafter set forth in a writing signed by an officer of ABC. All negotiations, proposals and representations are merged herein, and this writing constitutes the complete and exclusive statement of the terms and conditions of the Rebate Program between ABC and Rebate Recipient.\nThe Rebate Program is in lieu of local incentive plans, charge backs, credit adjustments or any similar programs or incentives. The Rebate Program will include all business units currently owned by Rebate Recipient as disclosed to ABC as of the signing of this agreement.\nRebate Recipient\u2019s rights and obligations under the Rebate Program are non-transferable and any purported assignment of these rights and obligations without the prior written consent of ABC are null and void and will act to relieve ABC of any obligations under the Rebate Program. Acquisitions or transfers of business units during the calendar year may be added to the rebate program for ongoing business but will not be retroactive to the beginning of the year and are subject to the prior approval of ABC, which may be withheld in ABC\u2019s sole and absolute discretion.\nABC reserves the right to discontinue, without liability, any merchandise at any time for any reason.\nAll purchases from ABC by the Recipient shall be governed by ABC\u2019s standard Terms of Sale, found at https://www.abcsupply.com/terms-of-sale or otherwise upon request.\nThe Rebate Program shall be governed by and construed according to the domestic laws of the State of Wisconsin without giving effect to any choice or conflict of law provision or rule (whether of the State of Wisconsin or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of Wisconsin. The state and federal courts with jurisdiction over Rock County, Wisconsin, shall have jurisdiction over any dispute concerning this Agreement.\nWaiver by ABC of any terms or conditions of the Rebate Program or waiver of any breach hereof shall not be construed as a waiver of any other term, condition, or breach. Determination that any provision of these terms and conditions is illegal or invalid shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remaining provisions of these terms and conditions.\nThe parties agree that this Agreement is confidential and further agree not to disclose any Confidential Information shared pursuant to this Agreement. As used herein, \u201cConfidential Information\u201d means any information pertaining to the pricing or rebates given by ABC to Recipient. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the term \u201cConfidential Information\u201d does not include information that is or becomes available to the public through no breach of this Agreement. The parties agree that such Confidential Information shall be used solely for purchasing decisions or otherwise in furtherance of the objectives of the Agreement. The parties shall use at least a degree of care consistent with best practices within its industry (and in no event less than a reasonable degree of care) to avoid and prevent disclosure of the Confidential Information.\nAPIs Terms of Service for ABC Supply Co., Inc.\nLast date modified: March 21, 2024\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nSection 1: Definitions\nSection 2: General Provisions\nSection 3: Account and Registration\nSection 4: Using our APIs\nSection 5: Your API Clients\nSection 6: Prohibitions and Confidentiality\nSection 7: Content\nSection 8: Intellectual Property; Attribution\nSection 9: Privacy\nSection 10: Termination\nSection 11: Liability for our APIs\nSection 1: Definitions.
